The best vacuum we've tested is the eufy Omni E28. This high-end upright vacuum offers powerful suction and debris pickup comparable to many corded models. It offers strong performance at a lower price. Not only does it offer comparable debris pickup to many corded models, but it's also easy to deploy and operate. Its surface detection system automatically adjusts suction power based on the surface, and it features a dust sensor that counts and measures the size of particles sucked into the dust bin.<br>
